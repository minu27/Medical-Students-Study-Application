Medical Students Study Application

Medical school students have one of the toughest jobs around: learning how to prevent, diagnose, and treat illness in high-stakes  
situations (sometimes even life or death). They need all the help they can get. Since memorization has traditionally been a huge part of 
medical school, smartphones and tablets have already come to play a huge role in modern medical treatment, allowing instant access to 
accurate data, calculations, and references. In this study application, the medical student can study anatomy of muscles along with their 
functions and categorize them by different regions of the human body to later on retrieve that data instantly to study. They can also 
update and make changes to the data that they store and also delete it when not needed. The system will have a login page and the student 
can add, search, update and delete the entries they make. This application is a study tool for learning anatomy of muscles, drugs, 
diseases, hormones, or any other data-dense subject. It can be a handy tool for students while revising before exams instead of searching 
every single term in the textbooks. This study application is suitable for medical students to memorize difficult terminology in their 
study which has vast syllabus.
